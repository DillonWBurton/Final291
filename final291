// Imports Java Util - Inserts all JAVA UTILITIES (Gives us extra things to work with.)
public class final291 {
// Inserts Public Class - Very Important otherwise code won't compile.
	public static void main(String[] args) {
		// Main Method is also really important for compiling also - Code won't run without it. 
		System.out.print("Enter how many entries in class: ");
		// Prints out how many entries you want to put in this program.
		Scanner input = new Scanner(System.in);
		// Inserted a scanner from the java UTILITY
		int arrayLength = input.nextInt();
		String[] myList = new String[arrayLength];
		// Assigns length of array from user input.
		System.out.print(myList.length);
		// Test Line (Remove after everyone is complete)
